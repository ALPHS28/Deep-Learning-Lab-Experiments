# Deep Learning Lab Experiments - Semester 7
## Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence (KTU 2019 Scheme)

Welcome to the Deep Learning Lab Experiments repository for Semester 7 of the Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) program, following the Kerala Technological University (KTU) 2019 Scheme. This repository contains a collection of experiments related to deep learning.
1. Familiarize basic python packages for deep learning such as Keras, Tensorflow etc.
2. Data pre-processing operations such as outliers and/or inconsistent data value
management. **
3. Implement Feed forward neural network with three hidden layers for classification
on CIFAR-10 dataset.**
4. Analyse the impact of optimization and weight initialization techniques such as
Xavier initialization, Kaiming Initialization, dropout and regularization techniques
and visualize the change in performance. **
5. Digit classification using CNN architecture for MNIST dataset. **
6. Digit classification using pre-trained networks like VGGnet-19 for MNIST dataset
and analyse and visualize performance improvement.**
7. Implement a simple RNN for review classification using IMDB dataset.**
8. Analyse and visualize the performance change while using LSTM and GRU
instead of simple RNN.**
9. Implement time series forecasting prediction for NIFTY-50 dataset. **
10. Implement a shallow auto encoder and decoder network for machine translation(by
using Kaggle English to Hindi neural translation dataset). **
